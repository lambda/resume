Open Source, Standards, and Technical Writing
---------------------------------------------

Open Source
:   [GitHub](https://github.com/lambda)

    Seven years work on [Halyard](https://github.com/lambda/halyard),
    an open source multimedia engine.

    [Proposed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1048-rename-soft-link-to-symlink.md)
    and
    [implemented](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/3cc84efcdd5727c0749d766d8abd79d8077f9cec)
    a change to the Rust programming language standard library, to
    separate symlink handling APIs for Unix-like and Windows platforms
    due to differing semantics.

    Assorted other small contributions to
    [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits?author=lambda),
    Ripgrep, Ansible, Monotone, and a number of other projects.

Standards
:   [Contributions to the WHATWG HTML
    standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/acknowledgements.html#acknowledgments),
    including discussion of semantics of the `<video>` element based
    on experience working on the Halyard multimedia engine.

Technical Writing
:   [Over 1000 answers on
    StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/69755/brian-campbell?tab=answers&sort=votes)
    and over 275,000 reputation, putting me in the top 0.03% of
